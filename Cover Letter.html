             <p>Dear Madam,</p> 
             <p>My intention for contacting you today is to express my interest in your vacancy at your company. I had the opportunity to be a cashier at Gourmet Basket for 8 months during my professional career. In this role, I was responsible for greeting all customers, answering phone calls, assisting customers with questions regarding the supermarkets and booking appointments for gift baskets. My dedication to quality and respect for my employer's standards lead me to believe that I can have an impact at your company. </p> 
             <p>Consequently, I am well versed in the duties associated with the position and can perform them with confidence. As a young, hard-working individual, I am convinced that I will be a tremendous asset to your establishment. My professors and peers have consistently praised me for being diligent in both my academic and professional lives. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I utilize proven communication, multitasking, and teamwork skills, which I am eager to use as a concierge at your establishment.</p> 
             <p>In conclusion, I am able to provide the skills and knowledge necessary for the position, as well as an eagerness to learn. I am grateful for your consideration, and I am eagerly anticipating your response. </p>
